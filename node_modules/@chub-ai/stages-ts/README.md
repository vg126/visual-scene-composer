# Chub Stages TypeScript Library

This is a collection of types and common classes used by stages.

Please [Read the Docs](https://docs.chub.ai/stages) for the most up-to-date information.

It's a very small library, and each file is self-documented with heavy annotations.

Please clone/fork the [Stages Template](https://github.com/CharHubAI/stage-template) for a starting point.

The stage in the GIF above is [here](https://github.com/lloorree/maze-stage).

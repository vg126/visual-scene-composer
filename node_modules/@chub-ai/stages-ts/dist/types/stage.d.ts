 What must be implemented by a stage.

 @about StateType
  The type that this stage persists message-level state in.
  This is primarily for readability, and not enforced.
 @description This type is saved in the database after each message,
  which makes it ideal for storing things like positions and statuses,
  but not for things like history, which is best managed ephemerally
  in the internal state of the ChubStage class itself.

 @about ConfigType
  The type of the stage-specific configuration of this stage.
 @description This is for things you want people to be able to configure,
  like background color.
